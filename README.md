## In the 21 century, technology is an integral part of our lives, it plays a huge role in our day-to-day activities.
With the use of technology comes the need for data. Data is facts and statistics collected for reference or
analysis. By providing an enormous amount of data, we allow others to personally identify us, track us, guess
our behavior and interests. Which means that we have lost or given up our right to privacy. In 1967 a new
milestone was reached with the publication of Alan Westinâ€™s Privacy and Freedom when he defined privacy
in terms of self-determination: privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for
themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. This report is
inspired by the book Extreme Privacy: What it takes to Disappear (Second edition) 2020 by Michael Bazzell. In
the book extreme privacy, the author Michael Bazzell has described what privacy is, and what methodologies
can be used to achieve Privacy. It describes how a person can perform basic tasks, what information about
them can be shared, what kind of technology can be used, and how it can be used concerning privacy. All the
scenarios and methods mentioned in the book are with respect to the county USA. There are no documents that
throw light on what privacy means and how it can be achieved in South Asian countries. This report is written
to better understand what privacy means and how it can be achieved in countries like India, Bangladesh, and
Nepal.
